## Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add a mlr3 DataBackend that can store one or multiple time-series.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Storing time-series data is not trivial, as many possible formats exist. 
Data formats can either be *long* or *wide*, and the time-series could be stored as 
different data types.

Used formats: 
- Basic: `ts`: Example `r data(Airpassengers)`
- Advanced: `xts`: [Cheatsheet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/r-xts-cheat-sheet) from library(xts)
- More general: `prophet` expects a `data.frame` with a `ds` (`as.Date`) and `y` (value) column.
- Very important: How was this solved in the old `mlr`?

Way more other formats exist, there is also a package that converts time-series formats around:
[tsbox](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox)
This has another helpfull resource: [link](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox)

## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Different forecasting methods require the data to be stored in different formats.
It is imperative to store data in a format that is flexible enough for different scenarios:

1. one or more time-series
2. time-series can be equi-distant or  not
3. time-series can be measured at equivalent grids.


Example: 

```r
# Equi-distant and same grid:
ts1 = ts(rnorm(12), frequency = 4, start = 2000)
ts2 = ts(rnorm(12), frequency = 4, start = 2000)
# Different grid
ts1 = ts(rnorm(12), frequency = 4, start = 2000)
ts2 = ts(rnorm(36), frequency = 12, start = 2000)
```


Proposals:

(Long Format): From `tsbox`: 

```
 In data frames, multiple time series will be stored in a 'long'
     format. tsbox detects a _value_, a _time_ and zero to several _id_
     columns. Column detection is done in the following order:

       1. Starting *on the right*, the first first ‘numeric’ or
          ‘integer’ column is used as *value column*.

       2. Using the remaining columns, and starting on the right again,
          the first ‘Date’, ‘POSIXct’, ‘numeric’ or ‘character’ column
          is used as *time column*. ‘character’ strings are parsed by
          ‘anytime::anytime()’. The time stamp, ‘time’, indicates the
          beginning of a period.

       3. *All remaining* columns are *id columns*. Each unique
          combination of id columns points to a time series.

```
This would look as follows (output is a data.table):
```
> ts_dt(x.ts)
          id       time value
  1: mdeaths 1974-01-01  2134
  2: mdeaths 1974-02-01  1863
  3: mdeaths 1974-03-01  1877
  4: mdeaths 1974-04-01  1877
  5: mdeaths 1974-05-01  1492
 ---                         
140: fdeaths 1979-08-01   379
141: fdeaths 1979-09-01   393
142: fdeaths 1979-10-01   411
143: fdeaths 1979-11-01   487
144: fdeaths 1979-12-01   574
```

## Rationale, drawbacks and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

The current design is by no means obvious, but it  is simple enough to be implemented
as a first approach.

Adherence to design principles: 
- [x] simple 
- [x] no or few depencies
- [x] extensible

- In the future we might want to capture a larger set of applications, similar to python's sktime.
  The current proposal might not be extensive enough.
- The main alternatives are listed above, but we might not know enough about the problems we want to solve
  to focus on a specific alternative.
- Converters from one format to another can be worked out if required.

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Alternatives and different approaches are implemented in many different packages, notably sktime, xts, tsibble etc.


## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Is / does this: 
- A new task type?
- Need new backend?
- Solve 95% of forecasting data situations?
  - Forecasting a single time-series
  - Forecasting with covariates
  - Forecasting multiple time-series
