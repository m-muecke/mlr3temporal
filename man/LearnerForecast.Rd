\description{
A LearnerForecast for for learner objects like \link{LearnerRegr}.

Learners are build around the three following key parts:
\itemize{
\item Methods \verb{$train()} and \verb{$predict()} which call internal methods.
\item A \link[paradox:ParamSet]{paradox::ParamSet} which stores meta-information about available hyperparameters, and also stores hyperparameter settings.
\item Meta-information about the requirements and capabilities of the learner.
\item The fitted model stored in field \verb{$model}, available after calling \verb{$train()}.
}

More classification and regression learners are implemented in the add-on package \CRANpkg{mlr3learners}.
More (experimental) learners can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/mlr3forecasting/}.
A guide on how to extend \CRANpkg{mlr3} with custom learners can be found in the \href{https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com}{mlr3book}.
